			 This weekend I decided to forego any of the usual exciting weekend activities (watching netflix alone and drinking beer) and start learning AngularJS. I began with some pre-reading of a handful of blogs, the majority of which went well over my head, and Codecademy's Angular track. First impression: <b>This framework runs on magic.</b>
		</p>
		<p class="post-content">
			One of the first things Codecademy introduced was filters. Seeing as I had just finished a jQuery project that required a specially formatted date, the date filter stood out the most. I had just written something with the same functionality in less characters than my jQuery function had <em>lines</em>. Obviously filters are only a piece of the Angular framework, but this had grabbed my attention. I jumped into some tiny Angular tutorial projects to get my hands dirty and quickly began to see the utility of the framework, even at the most basic levels.

			The first big stumbling block I ran into was the error messages. I was working on writing a custom filter to search a friends list by current location and I failed to properly load the module containing the filter. On running the code my console was filled with dozens of error messages, most of which referenced bits of unintelligible minified Angular source code. Once again Sean Walsh helped me out with his <a href="http://swalsh.org/blog/2014/07/01/quick-tip-angular-debugging/">blog post</a> on Angular debugging.

			I am blown away by helpfulness of the links the errors give you, even referencing other errors, all personalized to your code. After following a daisy chain of links I was able to track down the error in my code and load the module correctly (though the filter logic is still a work in progress).

			Overall I am hugely impressed with Angular. When things are working how you want them to it is just incredible, when things are broken there are fantastic resources for tracking down why. You can check out my first Angular project <a href="https://github.com/r-walsh/angular-friends">here</a>, still a work in progress at the time of writing.
